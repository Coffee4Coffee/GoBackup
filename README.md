<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A simple tool to schedule your backups daily, weekly or monthly. Since it uses the windows task scheduler, there is no need for any kind of installation, extra files, etc. Scheduled backups will notify the user through windows toast messages about the success or failure of the operation. Use this app to easily setup a scheduled backup for your important files, like images, documents, game saves, etc.

Since the windows task scheduler is the basis for this app, no other platform besides windows is currently supported.


## Uninstall
Delete all scheduled backup tasks either through the app or directly through the task scheduler and remove the GoBackup.exe.

## Known issues
- The app currently needs to be started with admin rights to work correctly
- Scheduled backups have a maximum period of 1 year
